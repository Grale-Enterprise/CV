  <h3>Education</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>For me education has been a tool to give me the knowledge of how to learn but I don't feel being educated under a specific curriculum is a measure of a persons intelligence, intelligence to me is a persons ability to perceive and understand
      what is
      around you and the way you interpret that is a measure of your intelligence.<br></li>
    <li> I completed my GCSE's in school but didn't excel due to lack of commitment, not ability.<br></li>
    <li> I worked in banking for a few years where I gained a level 2 qualification in administration.<br></li>
    <li> I've worked and lived abroad where I gained many life skills and met many different people from all over the world.<br></li>
    <li> I currently work in an engineering environment and have gained advanced skills in Microsoft packages, gained H&S certificates and completed a basic eletrical course.<br></li>
    <li> On top of any courses that I've taken I also constantly try to learn and improve my knowledge as I have interests in most things, the world truly is an amazing place with a lot to offer curious minds such as mine.</li>
